  event.isDefaultPrevented() â‡’ boolean

Returns true if `preventDefault()` was called for this event instance. This
serves as a cross-platform alternative to the native `defaultPrevented` property
which is missing or unreliable in some browsers.

{% highlight js %}
// trigger a custom event and check whether it was cancelled
var event = $.Event('custom')
element.trigger(event)
event.isDefaultPrevented()
{% endhighlight %}
